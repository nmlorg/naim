relevent mailing-list posts, _and_ make sure you have an up-to-date version of naim.

== naim issues ==
Whenever a buddy goes away, naim does a /wi on the buddy to attempt to discover away
messages.  AOL's TOC server recently have been returning invalid data when naim tries to
getinfo.
Dan posted to the naim-users mailing list about this issue on 10/13/2006.  His post can be
found at http://mail.n.ml.org/?1:mss:1648:200610:acamblbkfclhkbfpfdjk (you may with to use
the mirrored link below, as it's in a slightly better format)
The solution Dan came up with was to suppress this error message on the auto /wi.  naim
version 0.11.8.2.1 has been released to address this issue.  0.11.8.2.1 is the latest
stable version.

the naim.n.ml.org website and mailing lists should still be the first place to check for
information.  If the naim website is down, you may use the mirrors below, which is
