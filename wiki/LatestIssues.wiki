== naim issues ==

As of mid 2006, naim has been spitting out an error message that looks like:

{{{
*** ERROR: Server response was formatted incorrectly, can't find username in info HTML
}}}

=== Background ===

Whenever a buddy goes away, naim does a /wi on the buddy to attempt to retrieve
their away message. In mid 2006, AOL's TOC servers began returning an invalid
response to the request naim sent to retrieve users' profiles, leading to the
"Server response was formatted incorrectly" error above.

naim 0.11.8.2.1 was released with a workaround that simply suppresses this error 
message. naim 0.11.8.3 has been released and uses a different, previously 
undocumented command to retrieve user profiles, and appears to work reliably.

== mirrors ==

The naim.n.ml.org website and mailing lists should still be the first place to
check for information. If the naim website is down, you may use the mirrors
below, which is generally up-to-date:
