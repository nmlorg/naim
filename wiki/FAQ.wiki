=General=
==How do I send an IM? &bull; How do I add someone to my buddy list?==
To simply send a message to someone who is not in your buddy list, just type /msg
buddyname hello there. However, if you would like to engage in a conversation with
someone, you should first add them to your buddy list and create a window for them. Just
type /addbuddy buddyname or /addbuddy "buddy name" to add them to your list. If they are
online, a window will be created automatically for them. If they are not online, you can
type /open buddyname to open a window for them manually.

Once a window has been opened for a buddy, you can use the Tab, Home, and End keys to
cycle through your list of windows to find them, or type /jump buddyname to go directly to
their window. Once you are in their window, anything you type that doesn't start with a
"/" will be sent to them as a message. If the buddy is not online when you type your
message, the message will be saved and sent the next time your buddy signs on. 

=Navigation=
==How do I get the buddy list or status window to come back?==
The window list window and the status window both default to autohide mode: Whenever
either one of them changes, they will appear on the screen for $autohide seconds, then
disappear again. However, if you would like to make the window list window stay visible
permanently, you can use F4 or Ctrl-F to cycle between autohide, always hidden, and always
visible modes. There is also a /winlist command which will allow you to specify a setting
to use in your .naimrc file.

==Are there any short cuts to help make talking to multiple people easier?==
naim separates each conversation into a different window, which you can cycle through
using Tab, Home, End, and the /jump command. Your windows will be listed in the window
list window in the upper-right corner of your screen, which is usually hidden when you're
talking to someone. However, if you are in buddyA's window, and buddyC sends you a
message, the window list window will unhide itself, buddyC's name will appear in yellow,
and the []'s around his name will turn into ()'s. This means buddyC's window has changed
since the last time you have seen it. In order to make chatting with multiple buddies
easier, the /jump command will take you to the next "yellow" buddy if no name is provided.
Therefore, if you send a message to buddyA and are waiting for a response, and buddyC
sends you an IM in the meantime, you can just type /jump to take you directly to buddyC's
window. If buddyA sends you a message while you are then talking to buddyC, typing /jump
again will take you back to buddyA's window.

The keys F8 and Ctrl-N do the same thing as typing /jump with no arguments, to make
chatting even easier.

==How can I jump to the beginning of the line when running naim in screen?==
Under normal convention, Ctrl-A jumps to the beginning of the input line and Ctrl-E jumps
to the end. GNU Screen uses the Ctrl-A key for detaching, switching windows, etc. To jump
to the beginning of the line when running naim under screen, simply press Ctrl-A a (that
is, hold Ctrl, press 'a', let go of Ctrl, and press 'a' a second time).

==When using /bind, what keys are A1, A3, B2, C1, and C3?==
According to the ncurses header file, these keys correspond to the Home, End, PgUp, and
PgDn keys on the numeric keypad, as such:
{{{
/* The keypad is arranged like this: */
/* a1    up    a3   */
/* left   b2  right  */
/* c1   down   c3   */
}}}

I have never used a computer keyboard which used these bindings instead of KEY_PGUP, etc.,
but I included them in naim's /bind "just in case."

==Is there a way to go backwards in my buddy list?==
Home, Alt-Tab, and Shift-Tab will cycle backwards through your window list.

However, on my system at least, Shift-Tab generates the same control sequence as Tab by
itself. Typing:
{{{
loadkeys -d
keycode 15 = Tab Tab
alt keycode 15 = Meta_Tab
shift keycode 15 = F26
string F26 ="\033[Z"
}}}

into the command prompt on my machine before running naim allows Shift-Tab to work like
Home. This affects other curses programs (including Lynx) as well, so you may consider
adding that to your system boot scripts.

=Configuration=
==How can I configure naim?==
Many aspects of naim's operation are configurable through the use of variables, such as
$autohide (which controls how long the status window and window list window will appear on
the screen when one changes). To change these variables, use the /set command. For
example, to make both windows wait around for 10 seconds, instead of the default 3, just
type /set autohide 10.

For most other configurable pieces, there are specific /-commands to use, which will be
described in /help commands. For example, to add me to to your buddy list, just type
/addbuddy nmlorg or /addbuddy "n ml org".

==Is there a way to have naim save my configuration settings for the next time I start naim? &bull; Where can I get an example .naimrc (naim configuration file)?==
naim will read start-up commands from a file called .naimrc in your home directory, so all
of your configuration commands can be placed there.

naim includes a /save command, which will attempt to create a suitable .naimrc file based
on your current settings. So, once you have configured naim to your liking, just type
/save and naim will use the same settings the next time it starts up (including your buddy
list, channels you have joined on IRC, etc.). The generated .naimrc is also
auto-documented, so feel free to use /save to create a "default" .naimrc, and customize it
by hand using a text editor.

You can /set autosave 1 to have naim automatically write .naimrc whenever you /quit

==How do I configure naim to be nice with GNU Screen?==
Solution under Console Display Issues applies.

==Is it possible to disable the timestamps every 30 minutes?==
Type /set tprint 0.

==Is there a way to disable sounds in naim?==
The only sounds naim should make are for $beeponim or $beeponsignon, so you can just /set
beeponim 0, etc. to shut them off.

==How do I change the colors?==
The /setcol command will let you manipulate the colors. Type /setcol by itself to see what
the current values are, then /setcol buddy blue, etc. to change them.

==Does naim support inverse/blinking text, or changing the background for specific buddy types separately from the whole buddy list?==
At present, no. If enough people request that ability, I will add it to the next release.

==Why do some people I talk to have colored text?==
naim's default behavior is to honor  tags sent by other users, which can unfortunately
lead to situations in which the other user has chosen a font color that clashes with your
background. You can either use the /setcol command to change your own background, ask them
to pick a less offensive foreground, or /set color 0 in naim to disable  tag processing.

=Profiles=
==How can I get someone's profile?==
naim includes a /whois (/wi, /info) command to retrieve all information AIM keeps on AIM
users, including the profile. Unfortunately, AOL users' profiles are not visible to AIM
users through any mechanism.

==How can I set my own profile?==
If you have a file called .naimprofile in your home directory when naim starts, naim will
use its contents instead of the built-in default. You can send SIGHUP (killall -HUP naim)
from the command line or type /readprofile .naimprofile while naim is running to reload
your .naimprofile.

==Is there a way to view a user's away message other than sending them a message?==
Unfortunately, the TOC protocol does not appear to have such a capability. naim uses a
workaround (it puts your away message in your profile when you go /away), so naim can view
other naim users' away messages, but I am unfamiliar with any mechanism to retrieve a
WinAIM, etc. user's message (other than sending them an IM and hoping they send back an
autoresponse).

==How does Gaim get the away message when you do the GetInfo? Why does naim use TOC instead of Oscar? Isn't Oscar newer?==
Many other AIM clients use an alternative protocol, Oscar, which does have this
capability. The original AIM protocol was Oscar, and AOL later created TOC to serve the
needs of their Java client. In 1998 AOL released a public document specifying details of
the TOC protocol, for use by third-party clients such as naim. Since then, they have made
many significant changes to the Oscar protocol to discourage third-party client
maintainers from using Oscar. It is possible for third-party clients to use the Oscar
protocol, but I would prefer to spend my time working on new features to spending it in
keeping up with AOL's latest protocol revisions, rush-testing new releases, and
publicizing the problem and availability of corrected versions.

=Buddy List=
==How do I remove someone from my buddy list? /delbuddy isn't working.==
The /addbuddy and /delbuddy commands are used to manipulate your buddy list, not your
window list. naim includes a feature called autoquery which makes naim open windows for
buddies who are online when you sign on, and for buddies that sign on after you; this is
why /addbuddying someone causes a window to open for them. To disable this feature, type
/set autoquery 0.

If you /close a window for a buddy, naim will keep them on your buddy list; if they sign
on again, naim will open a window for them. However, immediately after you /close a
window, you can type /delbuddy to remove that individual from your buddy list. 

==Every time I start up naim, your name (naim help) is always added to my buddy list! How can I stop that?==
naim will read start-up commands from a file called .naimrc in your home directory. If
this file doesn't exist, a built-in default is used instead, and one of the things it does
is add my screen name to your buddy list. If you don't like this behavior, you can
/delbuddy naimhelp, then /save to write-out a .naimrc which will not contain me in your
buddy list. If you have used /save in the past without first removing me, your .naimrc
will include an addbuddy naimhelp, which you will need to remove manually (or /delbuddy me
and type /save again).

==One of my contacts always shows up offline, even when he is talking to me. What is wrong?==
There are several possibilities. If you have not received any messages from the buddy:

  * Your buddy has you blocked. This will prevent your buddy from seeing you online, and will prevent you from seeing your buddy online. Neither of you will be able to send messages to each other or retrieve each other's profile. You can check for this by using the /info buddyname command from two accounts at the same time. If one /info buddyname fails while the other succeeds, it is likely your contact has blocked the account where /info fails.
  * You have your buddy blocked. Blocking has the same effects regardless of which user is doing the blocking. You can check to see if you have blocked the buddy by checking ignore (which provides a list).
  * Your buddy has privacy mode enabled and has not added you to the allow list. Privacy mode makes it so only people on a special allow list can communicate with the user, and all other users are treated as if they are blocked (as with 1. or 2.). Many clients use their buddy list as the allow list. You can tell this is happening if you are able to /info buddyname from one account but not from any others. 

If you have or have not received messages from the buddy in question, it may be one of the
following:

  * You have exceeded the maximum number of buddies for your account. At the time of writing, AOL's Instant Messenger servers limit each account to 200 simultaneous buddies. The protocol does not declare this limit and the server does not emit an error message if you go over it; your buddy tracking simply starts behaving erratically. You can check for this by using the /names command and manually counting entries.
  * Your buddy is using the invisible feature of AOL Instant Messenger. This feature is similar to the privacy feature mentioned in 3., but only blocks tracking information. Userinfo requests and private messages can still be sent between clients. Unfortunately, this clashes with naim's automatic message queueing feature, and causes the unfortunate side effect of not being able to send messages to invisible users. You can tell this is happening if you have less than 200 buddies, a user is showing up as offline, but the user is also able to send you messages (and you are unable to reply).
  * The AIM service is experiencing technical difficulties and your session has become unstable. This happens from time to time, and breaks naim's session tracking ability in the same way as the invisible feature. You can not usually confirm or rule out this possibility. 

=Connections=
==I read somewhere naim is an IRC client as well, is this true? Will it allow me to be on IRC and AIM simultaneously?==
Is there a way to juggle two open connections? I noticed that if I have an AIM/TOC
connection open, and then open an IRC connection, then I can't switch to any of the
windows of the old connection with the normal keys (Tab, Home, and End).

naim supports the TOC1 (AIM and ICQ), IRC (EFnet and Undernet), and SLCP (The lily CMC)
protocols. naim also supports multiple simultaneous connections, allowing you to have as
many open connections as your system supports.

For example, type /newconn Undernet IRC to create a separate connection window for IRC
called "Undernet", then /connect nickname us.undernet.org to connect.

Use the Ins and Del keys to switch between connections. Your current connection will
appear on the right side of the status bar next to the amount of time you have been
connected. Active windows will show up regardless of which connection window you are in,
and Ctrl-N will cross connections to jump to the next active window.

==Does naim support connecting to AIM through a proxy server?==
naim does not have specific proxy support, but all is not lost! The ProxyChains utility
"allows you to use SSH, TELNET, VNC, FTP and any other Internet application from behind
HTTP(HTTPS) and SOCKS(4/5) proxy servers. This 'proxifier' provides proxy server support
to any app." As of this writing, ProxyChains is available from http://proxychains.sf.net/.

==Do you happen to know of any Yahoo!, MSN Messenger, etc. clients similar to naim?==
naim already supports IRC (http://www.irchelp.org/), and work is underway at adding Yahoo!
and MSN Messenger support. Please contact me if you are anxiously waiting for these, or
any other protocols, so our available energies can be directed where they are most desired.

=Logging=
==How does logging work in naim? Does it support per connection, or per buddy logging?==
To enable session logging for connection AIM, type /set AIM:logfile aim.log and then /set
AIM:log 1.

naim also includes support for per-window logging, which is always enabled. naim will log
all window activity into a `~/.naimlog/<conn>/<name>.html` file by default. For example, any
messages you exchange with "naim help" will be logged to ~/.naimlog/AIM/naimhelp.html .

To turn off per-window logging, type /set logdir "/dev/null" and then /save. 

=IRC=
==How do I keep from manually logging into all of my servers and channels everytime I login?==
Using the /save command after you've logged into all of your servers and channels will
save those settings, and automatically log back into them the next time you sign on. If
you have registered names which require passwords, naim will prompt you for them when
logging back in.

==What commands can I use in a naim IRC connection?==
naim implements many common IRC commands. Here are a few:

  # `/join <channel>` - joins a channel
  # `/part <channel>` - parts a channel
  # `/accept <filename>` - accepts a file transfer
  # `/CTCP <nick>` - requests another user's version information.
  # `/whois <nick>` - requests another user's whois information.

==Can I set modes in IRC?==
naim supports several basic channel-operator commands, including /op, /deop, /kick, and
/topic, but is not intended to be used as a channel maintenance client (a task usually
better left handled by "IRC bots," which usually will not ban their friends after getting
into arguments with them).

==Can I at least send a raw command to the IRC server?==
Send a private message to the special target ":RAW", i.e. /msg :RAW MODE #channel +s Note
that you will not be able to see the side-effects of most :RAW commands unless you /set
showraw 1 first.

==Where can I find naim help on IRC?==
The official naim channel is #naim on the EFnet IRC Network. This is the default location
you enter if you start naim as nirc on the command line, or create a new IRC connection
and /connect without specifying a server. 

=Keyboard Input=
==Is there any way to get naim to not automatically escape the ampersand? Can I insert newlines into my messages?==
naim includes a paste mode which changes naim's escaping behavior. In normal input mode,
the keys &lt; &gt; &amp; are all translated to &amp;lt; &amp;gt; &amp;amp;. When in paste
mode, &lt; &gt; &amp; are left alone, but multiple spaces are converted to &amp;nbsp; and
the Enter key becomes &lt;br&gt;. To toggle paste mode press Ctrl-P.

=Console Display Issues=
My Linux console displays + and | instead of the line-drawing characters in the window
list window. How do I fix this? My Linux console displays bold text as regular text. How
do I fix this? My Linux console does not display line-drawing characters at all, leaving
holes on my screen. How do I fix this? The window list window appears distorted on my
screen, and does not slide off cleanly. How do I fix this?

This is a deficiency in the Linux kernel's console driver related to UTF-8
(internationalization) support. If you are using Red Hat Linux 8.0 or newer, or Fedora
Core, or any other distribution based on either of these, you need to disable UTF-8 in
your console session. Open /etc/sysconfig/i18n and remove the ".UTF-8" suffix in the LANG
setting and comment out the SYSFONT line entirely. Reboot your system. If you live outside
of the U.S., I am sorry; you can either have pretty text or internationalization support.
Please lodge your complaint with the Linux kernel maintainers; I have no control over this. 

==Configuring Mac OSX Terminal to Work with naim==
The Mac OSX terminal does not play nice with naim by default. For example, PgUp and PgDown
scroll the terminal window instead of scrolling the current window in naim. This is easy
to fix:

*Terminal > Window Settings > Keyboard*

For each of the following keys, click edit and change the action to "send string to
shell:". Then enter the appropriate sequence for each:

*\033[4~*    (end)

*\033[1~*    (home)

*\033[5~*    (page up)

*\033[6~*    (page down)

Keep in mind when you type the backslash ("\"), OSX will automatically change it to a
double backslash ("\\"). You need to leave the double backslash while you're typing the
rest of the control sequence. When you're done typing the control sequence it will look
like this: *\\033[4~*

Before you click OK you need to use the arrow keys on your keyboard, and then the delete
key, to remove one of the backslashes. Before clicking OK, the control sequence should
look like this: *\033[4~*


This was tested on Mac OSX 10.4, but should work on other versions as well. 

=Support=
==I think I've found a bug, what do I do?==
First, check the BUGS file that is distributed with naim. If you see the bug listed and
marked with a high priority, keep a look out for new versions at the distribution site, or
through your package maintainer.

If your bug is marked low priority, then evaluate whether it is of high or low priority to
you. If you feel this is a significant issue, go ahead and send me an email asking me to
get a move on the fix. If it's just a minor inconvenience, the fact that it is in BUGS
means I am aware of it already, so you won't need to bring it to my attention.

If it is not in the BUGS file at all, contact the appropriate maintainer (which may be me)
to let them know, and carbon copy the message to me so I can keep track of its resolution
progress.

==How do I figure out who to contact for issues regarding naim?==
The README file should contain the most up-to-date contact information for the people
responsible for naim (including the maintainers of various package distributions, for
FreeBSD, Debian, etc.).
