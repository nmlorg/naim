#summary Some notes on using naim's SVN/SC repository.

= Introduction =

I'm going to keep a running log here of what I'm doing as I set up naim's SC repository in the hopes that other people will find it useful for fixing it if it breaks.

= Other documentation on SC =

= Setting up for the first time =
== Setting up my environment ==
I use an Ubuntu system. YMMV. Ubuntu is totally brain damaged when it comes to Ruby, I hear, so it's probably less work for you.

_Why /sc? We already had a trunk and branches directory, and I didn't know whether SC would romp on it. If we don't like it, it makes it easier to armarf it, and if we like it, we can just move it in its entirety on top of /svn/._
