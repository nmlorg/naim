		<li>When you first start naim, brief usage instructions will be displayed on the screen.</li>
		<li>To get started, type &#145;&#145;<b><font color="#00A000">/connect</font>&nbsp;<font color="#A0A000">screenname</font></b>&#146;&#146; and type in your password when prompted.</li>
		<li>If all went well, the big blue <i>status window</i> will hide itself at the top of your screen, and the green/blue <i>window list window</i> will scroll off the right edge of your screen, leaving you in a query window ready to talk to me, naim help. You can tell this by looking at the bottom of the screen: <code>&nbsp;HH:MMpp&nbsp;<font color="#A0A000">screenname</font>&nbsp;[Query:&nbsp;<b>naim&nbsp;help</b>]</code>.</li>
		<li>Type something. Anything you type that doesn't begin with a slash (&#145;&#145;/&#146;&#146;) will be sent as an IM. Go ahead and say &#145;&#145;hello&#146;&#146; to me.</li>
		<li>If you already had people on your account's buddy list when you switched to naim, they will also have windows open for them. If you want to add a buddy, use the /addbuddy command, as in &#145;&#145;<b><font color="#00A000">/addbuddy</font>&nbsp;&quot;<font color="#A0A000">my buddy</font>&quot;</b>&#146;&#146;. You can cycle through your open windows by using the <b>Tab</b> key, or you can jump to a specific buddy by using the /jump command, as in &#145;&#145;<b><font color="#00A000">/jump</font>&nbsp;<font color="#A0A000">buddyname</font></b>&#146;&#146;.</li>
		<li>Take note of the line above where you type, naim may try to save you time by offering to finish what you're typing:<br/>
			<div style="background: #000080"><code><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;I can finish what you're typing; just press Tab.</font></code></div>
			<div style="background: #000000"><code><font color="#FFFFFF">/j</font><span style="background: #808000"><font color="#000000">u</font></span><font color="#808000">mp</font> <font color="#808080">Go to the specified window or the next 'active' one</font></code></div>
		</li>
		<li>That's it. If there's anything else you need to know, check out the <a href="http://naimdoc.net/index.php/FAQ">frequently asked questions</a> or ask me on AIM.</li>
