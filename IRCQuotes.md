[14:49:36]  <n_> nope                                                                    
[14:49:56]  <fps> then I fail to see the importance

```

```
[20:33:46] <n_> there were 7 questions about kitties on the LSAT
[20:33:58] <n_> and the essay question was about proving that kitties are squishy
[20:34:05] <n_> so I was like, I got this!

```

```
[14:43:24] <LiENUX> do you just substitute kitty for random words?
[14:43:41] <n> sometimes
[14:43:47] <n> but only when it makes kitty

```

```
[00:55:57] <joshua_> whoa whoa whoa
[00:55:59] <joshua_> my ssh key works
[00:56:34] <Eminence> so does my cat

```

```
[15:07:15] <Grackle> Hmm, I'm going to go against the grain and use
                     my password as my cat's name.

```

```
[21:18:18] <njoshua_> I then looked at w3m's code, went "AUuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuggggh" and
tripped over the cat.

```


### Robots ###
```
[18:56:22]  <fjord> you guys have got it all wrong - computers were intended to be
                    hacked. hacked by robots. totally sweet huge robots from 
                    space. also sour.

```

```
[23:29:59]  <fjord> he's probably off building super sweet robots
[23:30:04]  <fjord> and by probably i mean definately

```

```
[22:05:46] <n_> the best user experience will almost surely be to have a passive aggressive robot

```

### People (or the lack thereof) ###
```
[04:04:46] <joshua_> I keep a distance between my online identities and my 
                     real life identity.
[04:05:15] <Eminence> which is probably wise (no pun intended)
[04:05:54] <hule> that's easy for you joshua
[04:05:59] <hule> you don't exist in real life
[04:07:02] <Eminence> hah
[04:07:42] <n> I've met him, twice!
[04:08:25] <hule> those were catnip-induced hallucinations

```

```
[00:27:26] <n> I have yet to sign on and not see hule drunk in like 2 years

```

```
[02:02:44] <n_> only some of my personalities are insane

```

```
[03:55:54] <caillon> n just coughed up 3 lungs and a cat

```

### Misc ###
```
[02:43:37] <n> seriously; people who complain about other people's clients' benign 
               behavior are assholes and shouldn't be tolerated
[02:44:20] * n goes and gets more Christmas ice cream

```

```
[01:59:24] <n> anyone really turned on by Bugzilla?
[01:59:49] <hule> the name makes me spontaneously climax

```

```
[02:02:14] <Eminence> but databases are so fun (!)
[02:03:08] <n> if by fun you mean torturous to the souls of mere mortals, I might agree 
               with you, but I'd have to think about whether torturous was strong enough

```

```
[02:44:09] <hule> that's what naim does for me.  ncurses-induced orgasms, baby!
[02:44:22] <Eminence> (hule-quoted)

```

```
[21:47:25] <joshua_> they just go "oh shit, bees!" and longjmp() the fuck out of there

```

```
[23:14:41] <n_> it's too bad Chlamydia has to be a venereal disease, it's 
                such a pleasant-sounding word

```

```
[14:19:09] <n_> the code you gave me last night or older code?
[14:19:57] <joshua_> older code including the code I gave you last night
[14:20:06] <caillon> does it please you to say older code including the code 
                     I gave you last night?
[14:20:13] <n_> I haven't hit any leaks in older code
[14:20:21] <caillon> please continue.
[14:20:28] <joshua_> n_: you can hit him, you know

```

```
[21:12:28] <n_> have you tried that new pizza place on Midnight Road?
[21:12:32] <n_> what's it selling?
[21:12:33] <n_> pizza
[21:12:36] <n_> oh, that's nice

```

```
[21:14:40] <PMT> naim should convert :toot: and similar to <i don't know how to express
myself without emoticons>
[21:14:52] <Eminence> haha, indeed
[21:15:08] <PMT> except for :slick:
[21:15:11] <PMT> that one is all right

```
[18:26:25] <n_> only this morning you refered to me as a cancerous polyp on the anus of
humanity
[18:26:35] <n_> in an affectionate way!

```

```
[02:02:15] * n_ sprays hule with cat urine
[02:02:52] <Eminence> ewwwwwww

[02:39:46] <_n> please Lord, let OpenBSD have some kind of backdoor that causes all
installed machines to 
                download ISOs of some other operating system (any other operating system),
mount on loopback,
                install over OpenBSD, and reboot into it
[02:40:00] <_n> and please let that trigger soon

```

[20:46:53] <n_> if you justify their behavior one more time, I will /kill you several times
[20:47:01] <n_> their behavior is utterly unacceptable
[20:47:07] <n_> completely, and with no reasonable justification possible
[20:48:16] <joshua_> I agree that they have taken way too long to do it, but realize that
                     you are totally untrusted to be the buyer you claimt o be, and they're
                     anywhere between a couple hundred dollars and several thousand dollars 
                     in the hole depending on how expensive the TV was that you bought if 
                     you turn out not to, in fact, be Dan Reed
