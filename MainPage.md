## What is naim? ##

naim is a console client for AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), AOL I Seek You (ICQ), Internet
Relay Chat (IRC), and The lily CMC. The main developer is Daniel Reed. (Unofficial but
very useful patches by Joshua Wise)

  * naim includes unique features like zero-configuration peer to peer "encryption", automatic message queueing, and incoming message modification (to correct common spelling mistakes and expand common abbreviations; see /help filter).
  * naim also includes powerful dynamic module support, allowing developers to modify all
major aspects of naim's behavior.
  * Third-party plug-ins have been used to extend naim's functionality for use in embedded monitoring clients, and for use as host to automatic clients (bots).
  * The naim-modules package (distributed below) includes several example plug-ins, including a telnet server (nsocket), an interactive bot (naimusers), and a simple anti-spam measure (nantispam).
  * When combined with GNU Screen (http://site.n.ml.org/info/screen/), naim is great to use as a chat client as well as an answering machine. Individual users can detach, log out, pack up and go home, then log back in from anywhere on the Internet to resume their naim session.

naim is maintained by an OPEN, DIRECTED COMMUNITY, and has been in development since October, 1998.

  * a total revamp of naim called "naimng" is currently under development for the next naim release. It will make liberal use of DBUS, and seperate the naim user interface from the core program, allowing the development of multiple interfaces to suit users needs (GUI, web, curses), as opposed to just the current ncurses interface.
