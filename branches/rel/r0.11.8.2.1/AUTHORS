BUG REPORTS
       Before reporting any bugs, please review Simon Tatham (of PuTTY)'s won-
       derful essay, How to Report Bugs Effectively at http://www.chiark.gree-
       nend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html.

       To  report  issues  with  the front end (things having to do with buddy
       windows, colors, .naimrc, and anything else  "user  oriented")  contact
       the naim maintainer, Daniel Reed <n@ml.org>.

       To  report issues with the protocol library (problems connecting, error
       messages while connected, and anything else not a  part  of  the  front
       end)  contact the FireTalk maintainer, now also Daniel Reed <n@ml.org>.

       To  report  issues  with  the  FreeBSD  port,  contact  Ryan  T.   Dean
       <rtdean@cytherianage.net>.


FEATURE REQUESTS
       If  you  would  like  to  suggest  new features or significant behavior
       changes, subscribe to the naim-users mailing list and suggest it there.
       I  get  a  lot  of mail every day, and non-bug reports get a fairly low
       priority. The best way to make sure something you want  is  implemented
       is  to  post  it  to naim-users whenever I ask for them on the list. To
       subscribe, send a blank email  to  <naim-users-subscribe@n.ml.org>  and
       reply to the confirmation message you will receive.
