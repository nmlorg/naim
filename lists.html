The &lt;<font color="#B00000">naim-announce</font>@n.ml.org&gt; mailing list is
used to announce major events related to naim, including new release versions
and changes to any of the supported services (AOL Instant Messenger/ICQ, EFnet
IRC, Undernet IRC, and The lily CMC) that might require end-site or end-user
changes. Messages sent to <font color="#B00000">naim-announce</font> will also
be sent to both other naim-* lists; <font color="#B00000">naim-announce</font>
is primarily intended for package maintainers and site administrators.

The &lt;<font color="#909000">naim-users</font>@n.ml.org&gt; mailing list is the
appropriate place to discuss all issues where feedback from and/or the consensus
of the larger naim-using community is needed. The naim-using community may use
this list for any purposes of its own, but the technical team relies on this
list as a place to send polished RFCs and to thoughtfully discuss major changes
before implementation.

The &lt;<font color="#009090">naim-technical</font>@n.ml.org&gt; mailing list is
for technical discussion between naim developers (programmers and other highly
interested individuals). It is used to discuss work that has not been refined to
the point of releasing a complete RFC to <font
color="#909000">naim-users</font>. Examples of expected topics include the
ongoing naimNG work, future work to create new protocol drivers, etc. This is
<b>not</b> the place to ask user questions, even if they are of a technical
nature.
